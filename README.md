# LP-Optimization-Sifting-to-Overcome-CPLEX-Limits

This project focuses on solving a linear programming (LP) problem with 5000 decision variables and 500 constraints. The community version of CPLEX has a limit of 1000 variables, making it impossible to solve the problem as a whole. To overcome this limitation, the sifting procedure is used to iteratively optimize subsets of the variables.
